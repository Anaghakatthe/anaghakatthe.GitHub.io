## Welcome to Big Data Analytics

_Big data is a large complex data that is both **structured and unstructured**. It is present in multiple formats. Since data is huge, we need special tools to analyze data, find patterns and decrypt valuable information from it. Big data can be effectively specified in three different ways: **Size in terms of memory, Type of data and Data acquisition rate**_. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Anaghakatthe/anaghakatthe.GitHub.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
